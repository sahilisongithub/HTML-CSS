    A mountain is a large natural elevation of the Earth's surface that typically has a steep slope and a summit or peak. Mountains are formed by tectonic activity, volcanic eruptions, or erosion. They can be found on every continent and are home to a wide variety of plants and animals. Some famous mountains include Mount Everest, Mount Kilimanjaro, and Mount Denali.
